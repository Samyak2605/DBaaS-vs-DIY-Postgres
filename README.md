DBaaS vs DIY Postgres: Comparison
Criteria	DBaaS (e.g., Cloud SQL, RDS)	DIY (e.g., StatefulSet on GKE)
Setup Time	⚡ Fast — Few clicks or Terraform modules to provision	🛠️ Manual — Set up StatefulSet, PVCs, Secrets, Services, etc.
Maintenance Effort	🧘 Minimal — Backups, upgrades, patching handled by provider	🔧 High — You maintain updates, backups, scaling, and failover
Backup Management	✅ Simple — Scheduled automatic backups, point-in-time restore	🧪 Manual — Must set up cron jobs or Velero, configure storage, monitor
Cost	💸 Higher — Pay for convenience, uptime SLAs, and premium features	💰 Lower — Only pay for raw compute and storage, but time cost is higher
Scalability	📈 Managed — Easy to scale vertically/horizontally (with replication options)	🧱 Complex — Requires reconfiguration, may require downtime or migration
Security	🔐 Advanced — VPC, IAM roles, encryption at rest and in transit	🧯 Manual — You must configure secrets, TLS, access control yourself
Availability	🌐 High — Multi-zone support, automated failover	🚨 Depends — Needs manual setup for HA and zone replication
Use Case Fit	✅ Ideal for production environments where uptime, backup, and reliability matter	🧪 Good for development or cost-sensitive sandbox projects
